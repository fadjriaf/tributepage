                            seen
                            as a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president, he liberalized
                            Indonesia's press and political party laws.</p>

                            aircraft
                            design, aircraft with propeller technology that could land and take off vertically. The
                            blueprint was later purchased by the United States Space Agency, NASA.</p>

                        <p class="story">Habibie got the title <b>"Mr. Crack"</b> after he discovered the crack
                            propagation theory. It
                            was
                            a mathematical model that useful for predicting crack propagation behavior in aircraft
                            structures to the atomic level. This theory is important because at that time many aircraft
                            accidents occurred due to structural failure.</p>
